# Project To-Do List

## Overview

- Ctrl + Shift + V
- [âœ”] Codename: Alpha Wave
- [ ] Project Description
- [ ] Create a fun application / portfolio project that is available in the google play store for free that provides revenue through non-egregious ad placement and optional ad viewing for bonuses and such.  - perhaps like a tamagotchi thing where there's like clothes and stuff and you gotta feed 'em and stuff.

## Planning

- decide unity version - I purport 6 since it's the newest LTS version and we can just deal with other environment compatibility issues when they arise.

- setup and link github repo between all users (environment setup)
- research to see if AWS is possible to implement since it's on a lot of requirements for jorbs
- would it be possible to program in c++ in unity? - just researched would need to create a whole project using a windows dll and then access it through a bridge mechanism - this would be for computationally intense tasks where c#'s managed runtime would underperform
